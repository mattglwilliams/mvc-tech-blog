## Description

For this project, I have created a tech blog where people can sign-up/login and add their own posts and comment on other peoples posts.

This is a full stack application that uses the MVC paradigm as its architectural structure. It uses sequelize as the ORM and Handlebars as the templating langauge to generate the views. It requires the following dependencies:

- bcrypt
- connect-session-sequelize
- dotenv
- express
- express-handlebars
- express-session
- handlebars
- mysql2
- sequelize

You can visit the deployed application here - https://matt-mvc-tech-blog.herokuapp.com/
